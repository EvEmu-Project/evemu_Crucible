request for smartbombs


as bubble code becomes more stable, consider updating/removing/recoding wander timer.
    - every 60s for every bubble object is a bit much.
    - check InBubble and IsOverlap code.

11:45:54 [DestinyWarning] Warp Cap need for Rifter(140007395) is 0.0007

verify skill attr 'in training' is being properly removed

noob ships do not Init() correctly....  most attrs are 0
    -- check this.  may be fixed already

salvager success crashes other salvagers and tractor

npcs not getting destiny warpstate set (sometimes - this is cause of rats not warping into belts)

after unloading module using ungroup, tried loading charge to newly-ungrouped module, and got this:
01:58:17 [ModTrace] ShipItem::LoadCharge - Trying to load Flameburst Light Missile from HiSlot6 to HiSlot7.

prop mod destiny call - update ship speed to AccelTime math isnt right...see cruc/MoveTrace and cruc/SpeedBoost
    - this is better after SpeedBoost() update, but still needs work (activate/deactivate working)

module add/remove isnt fully thought out at this point.
    - will need complete walk thru to verify proper operation
    - module states need a good lookover
moving mwd from one slot to another throws groupfit limited error
when moving module slots, module is offlined after refit
check charge flag - getting segfault on flagAutoFit for chargeRef in fx
check reload times for non-weapon modules
check/fix loading linked weapons
    - look over and correct loading with partial stacks (see UserError at MM::LoadCharge)
    - reloading grouped weapons should divide evenly between modules.
        it currently fills modules in slot order.

warp scram should deactivate mwd and deny activation (it IS a micro WARP drive...)

invul timer set on undock after login

check repack/reproc ships for insurance and delete if applicable
    - does client need update when insurance deleted?  no...ins is queried when needed
also check containers for contents and remove/deny before repack

check insurance payouts.   rounds full ship value up
    - this will need base prices fixed

base price estimator code 95% complete.
few prices wrong and not in crucible mkt data dump
static category names are a bit off (semantics)

check trade - ships retain insurance

check for item ownership before rename
    verify OnCfgDataChanged
    Structure items have throw.  not sure if this is valid

dungeon deco items need better placement

ship warp speed on attributes tab is wrong


error:
"turret not fitted on shipID (npc)"


...still not sure on this.  throws a shitton of errors in client error log
"Cleaning session *clientID 2888444* because it's ID doesn't match  0"


this is used for pricing update based on minerals.  this query returns ~300 items
SELECT * FROM `invTypeMaterials` WHERE `quantity` = 0


materials for implants are wrong.  this leads to incorrect price estimates

missing prices for salvage

*******************************************************
********  improvements

allianceDB  update this to use static members

Inventory contains a lot of "IsValidLocation" macros...verify if this is needed as-is or should be validItem

client login screen...these all need code to show data    CharacterDB::GetCharSelectInfo
    upcomingEventCount:
    unreadMailCount:
    unprocessedNotifications:
also need to optimize query....can join instead of using (current) multiple queries and variables

check into cosmic manager enabling checks/code....kinda dont make sense)
*** this below is wrong.  look into it.
20:21:01 [CMgr Msg] AnomalyMgr Initialized for Ibaria(30000053) with 2 Max Signals for security class 0.37.  Test Server is enabled


skill training...
    2x training bonus for new chars (<30d)

EVEDB::invGroups::Spawn_Container needs it own class
    - mostly for dungeons/deadspace
    - 477 types

remove InventoryDB (m_db) and associated code from itemfactory
remove character queries from InventoryDB
remove station/static queries from InventoryDB
remove *lsc_service and *cache_service from PyServiceMgr
    - lsc_service may be singleton.  channels should remain dynamic...will have to look into this more
    - cache_service....will have to look into this more before deciding.

AuditLogSecureContainer types not coded (data coded in EvE_Inventory.h)

skill error on queue update   - see cruc/skills/skill_error_new

look into changing (EvilNumber)DmgTypeAttribute to (struct)Inv::AttrData  (started.  still being used by sDataMgr)
    - may be able to delete the EvilNumber class, as it was created only to deal with attribute data, which we are getting away from with the struct.

journal msgs need to be implemented (wip)

standings
    - this is singleton (sStandingMgr)
    - basic standings hit db on every call.  probably way too much for static data
    - reproc/ram to remove individual standing code in favor of common code (evemath::standing?)
    - faction/corp standings should be static for npc groups
    - need to write standings code for corps and finish for others (char, agents)

TransportClosed error msgs located in common/python/pypacket.h

go thru all updated effect data and look for 'improved' ship data to update ours
    - specialized holds from rhea (not available in cruc)
    - updated barges from current live patch (hot tanks)
current fx data in db incomplete at best.  missing multiple items/defs
23:51:06 [FxError] guid empty for F85 Peripheral Damage System I using effectID 2302
isDefault used to send to activate for effectID
go thru all gfx "effect.xxx" and cross with EVEEffectID to verify
    - gfx display is wonky.  dunno why some show and some dont
    - stripminer on hulk working 20feb21
    - salvager on trasher working 20feb21
put EVEEffectID enum into namespace
turn fx sending on and follow calls to verify proper OnSpecialFX data
    - found and added client fx classification data to destinyMgr.h
    - remove xmlp data for specialFX and build packet in code?
    - remove specialFX10.  easier if specialFX is built in code, else send None...still not sure on what we can NOT send

check data sent for bound objects to see what we can use.
    verify members for bound objects.  we may need to add few more to avoid redirects (cant find data on effectiveness of static member vs multi-redirect call)
    client sends some data we dont necessarily need, due to server differences between us and live

pypacket building isnt completely right....some things dont need to be that deep.
some returns are put instead of substruct, and others dont have the 2 tuples that follow substruct.
no clue on criteria or exactly what goes where yet.

go thru all header #include to determine if it is actually needed in header as opposed to #include in .cpp

jettison now checks for can capy.
    - once full, loop stops and warning issued
    - updated loops for deployable items
    - need code for corp usage

AttributeMap::Change() has data for updated cap charge sending....not sure how/when to implement it

customInfo is actually used in client
    - there are many logConst and event** msgs not implemented/researched (LP, FacWar, StandingTransactions, more)

20:41:06 [Bound] InsuranceBound::InsureShip()
20:41:06 [AcctTrace] TranserFunds() - from: 90000000, to: 1000132, entry: 19, refID: 0, amount: 0.33, fKey: 1000, tKey: 1000
20:41:06 [AcctTrace] TranserFunds() - toID: 1000132 is neither player nor player corp.
20:41:06 [SvcMsg] New messageID: 1
20:41:06 [SvcMsg] Delivered message from 1000132 to recipient 90000000
    - ins mail working.  need contractID, expiry date, and few other things...
    -- this does NOT work....mailDB table is mailMessage.  this was saved in eveMail

system mail not working.  this would be nice to have, as many systems could(will) use it    -priority level: low
entire mail/notification system needs looking over, maybe rewrite to allow OnNotificationReceived sent from mail, as it should be.    -priority level: low-med
mailDB needs much love.


closely examine target mgr and see what we can improve.
    - test changing TargetEntry class (and enums) to struct
    - verify entries are placed timely and appropriately
    - multiple throw msgs not implemented (client msgs in dogmaim)
    - update targ/npcai to inform npc of yellowbox instead of locked
rewrite completed, but reverted due to multiple errors and inconsistencies (m_targMgr->OnTarget())

add cache calls/data for systems that use it after debugging and testing completed
    - bookmarks
    - agent data?

bookmarks in cargo have name correctly (bm 'memo' is it's player-given name), but mouseover shows  ` - {memo}` ....  what is blank space before '-'??
write new methods for List() and Move() for bookmarks where owner != player
currently, all bookmarks are donated to calling player when moved into cargo/hangar

finish DestinyManager::SendCloakFx()

PyRep --
    do we need float and double to be separated?
    currently both are sent as double, and some cases are using static_cast<float>
    not sure if client expects a difference.  would be a bit less data on wire in some cases

check client's locationID vs stationID.
    - multiple calls in client will test for these as separate values (tested separately)
    - verify our use of these is correct....
    - most tests use locationID first, then stationID2

systemmgr - use kills object instead of db hit
    - hit this object to avoid db hits for every kill
    - this will hold current counts
    - save to db every 15m, called by EntityList::Process() for active systems
    - add kill tracking to systeMgr
    - use systemMgr to update/track kills/hour data and update db as needed (use 15m call above)
    - load kill times when system boots.  use 15m timer call (from EntityList) to update data
    ** tried this...didnt work correctly.  disabled code

dbcore - query retry enables runaway server when query causes server disconnection (error)
    - should this be limited?
    - note: it only happens for malformed queries (while testing) from what i've seen.
    - may need null checks for mRow, mResult, mLengths (segfault on result returning NULL)
    -   this happens very, very seldom (2-3 times that i can recall)
    -   how much overhead will this add?
    server startup and one client with null checks:   (subsequent runs)
            DB   1505 times.    Hi: 16085.5000us        Lo: 167.5000us          Avg: 366.1477us
            DB   1505 times.    Hi: 14954.2500us        Lo: 165.5000us          Avg: 305.4390us
            DB   1508 times.    Hi: 11528.2500us        Lo: 163.2500us          Avg: 310.5827us

    server startup and one client without null checks:  (initial run)
            DB   1505 times.    Hi: 62847.0000us        Lo: 161.2500us          Avg: 364.7585us
    - very odd....how are adding null checks faster??   db cache maybe?


char creation - figure certs and set skills accordingly
    - currently, most new chars dont qualify for any certs.
    - they should at least have a starter profession cert


InvBrokerBound::Handle_GetInventory
    - incomplete
InvBrokerBound::Handle_GetInventoryFromId
    - this sets inventory flag when bound object created....needs more thought to finish code
    - there is NO checks for corp usage yet.
    - suspect many error msgs in client for this, but none are found/coded yet
    - wtf does 'passive' mean??  only called for char and ship during 'Prime'.  "dont load item" maybe?

InventoryBound  incomplete
  Handle_List()  -- this will need lots of work for t3 ships and corp usage
  ListDroneBay()
  SetPassword()
  RunRefiningProcess()
  TakeOutTrash()


DogmaIMBound::Handle_Activate
    - need to complete POS/Container cases and verify we're not missing anything
DogmaIMBound::Handle_Deactivate
    - same as above
DogmaIMBound::Handle_OverloadRack
DogmaIMBound::Handle_StopOverloadRack
    - both incomplete

GetMyInventory()->ContainsTypeByFlag
    - should this check for items in holds other than default cargoHold?
    - finish contents-by-flag map for this method

pi working.  currently rewriting process code  -priority level: lo
    - check/rewrite planet xml code as needed (minor improvement)
    - check if xml is needed or if structs are ok for all uses (improve code bloat)
    - code checks for route levels and mat'l volume xfer'd (limit volume xfer)

module/rack OL incomplete.  includes OL Heat (basic heat code done/working)  -priority level: low-med
activemodule c'tor - check/verify needsCharge code as some modules listed use scripts

dungeons - complete current wip code   -priority level: med-hi
dungeon mgr - factionID of "region sov" needs to be written to determine region sov holder (set to rogue drones at this time)   -priority level: low-med
    - figure out how to determine LCO in dungeon and spawn rats/waves near objects instead of middle of bubble

fleetData.h needs to be moved to common/EVE_Fleet.h and PODs put in fleet namespace
FleetBound could use updates (client->getchar->name, etc)

fleet boosts - apply directly to ship/modules when calculated
    - set leadership skill modifiers on char item, then have fleet boosts pull directly from char
    - apply either when undocking or as fleet is created and use OnModuleAttributeChange packet
    - this will give proper data to client when GetAllInfo() is sent
    - many fleet error msgs in client unused - noted in fleetdata.h
    - determine how to save fleetID for wrecks (SE has fleetID member...may save id to item.customdata)
    - MiningLaser::GetMiningVolume() uses calc's in method for boost.  this is in contrast with data in client (from GetAllInfo)

shooting wrecks to destroy loot.
    - this really is a thing on live.  implement it.

petition system missing most calls
    - this system hasnt been started
    - couple calls as skeleton code
    - notes for ~20 system calls (may be complete)

belt spawns - rework for better ship group selection   -priority level: med

belt manager 'active' status on timer?

contracts - start this system. current status unknown. this system is barely skeleton code at this time.  -priority level: low-med
contractProxy::GetMyExpiredContractList()

        forCorp = False
        numCorpRequiresAttention = 0
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'contracts'

missions/agents - agents working. courier missions working. currently ~50 missions, all levels.
next up is security missions.  will need dungeon work for these.   -priority level: hi

anomaly system - working. may need revisit after other systems mature.   -priority level: med
    - sig data needs work and common add/create method for scanning
    - verify AddSignal() calls for all items (needs work)
    - ships have shipScanResistance (511) but they are all zero.  also look into using sig radius as sigStrength
    - there is no "remove anomaly" or "cleanup anomaly" methods.....how we remove gutted sites?

added notes on scanner groupNames in anomalyMgr.cpp and more data in EVE_Scanner.h
    - field descriptions found in packets/Scan.xmlp
check anomaly spawn distance for in small systems.  current 4au seems far when system is <8au

ship/cargo scanning
    - not sure about this system yet
    - OnCargoScanComplete
    - OnShipScanCompleted
    - there are packets on both of these.  must make bpc updates play nice with scanner code.  may have to update client

reconnect to lost probes not implemented yet.

wh system - started.   k162 for deco only at this time (POC)   -priority level: low

player drones - skeleton started. needs functionality    -priority level: med-hi
drones mass and maxspeed need attention
does controller and controllerownerid change when assigning drone to other pilots?
ShipSE::LaunchDrone() needs bit of work.  drones are online and set to orbit after launch, before BW test
    -Drone::Launch() also needs updating after above is completed.
drone ai needs:
  - assigned ship killed, need code to reset
  - all states except idle
mining methods will need updates to test for drones vs pilots
move mining item depleted call to targmgr

RAM code - implement invention, re    -priority level: low
    - (reproc) update GetRecoverables to use sDataMgr...currently hitting db on every call...
    - some bp dont have invention data
    - invention and re will need lots of work
    - data interface dont show on install job tab (dunno why)
    - bpc may be a bit off (not sure why yet)

blueprints - look over data and verify
    - LPRR = -11??
    - research copy time.  huge discrepancy here....  3h20m base, <1m with skills???
    - was working on stacking bpc, but with singleton code, i dont think it's possible.

contact list - no notification when contacts login.  no initial contact status when logging in.  -priority level: lo

pos - started. drop, anchor, unanchor, online, offline working but no in-class checks. all tower mgnt tabs work and save. rest is wip.   -priority level: low
    - pos items in hangars still return true from IsPOSSE(), and throw weird errors because of this....needs more thought to properly implement (system is still young)
    - towers (and maybe others) must use orbitalState in slimItem.  this is EVEPOS::EntityState sent to client.  also uses OnSlimItemUpdated.  search client for this
    - structures need 'state' and 'status' variables looked over and possibly reset/fixed.  status is EVEPOS::StructureStatus and sent in slimItem.  state is EVEPOS::EntityState
    - reinforceValue data is in pos/Structure.h
    - mgrDB needs looking over for data types
    - add checks for necessary items before online can be processed
    - timers (anchor/online) arent updated to client properly (non-persistent)
    - add bm when tower, ihub, sbu, tcu anchored
    - finish removing multicast bullshit (sends on FF attr.radius update)
    - verify all effects for structures.  (some missing)

lsc system better, but incomplete and needs revisiting    -priority level: med-hi
    - may need xmlp code instead of muddled python decoding
    - whole system needs update or possible rewrite

link/unlink need a bit more logic work (as per notes in code)

can you repack t3 ships??
when t3 ship killed, pilot will lose sp in a required skill for each of the 5 subsystems.
    not sure how this is determined, or how many sp lost.

JumpCloneService needs work to allow capital ships `show info` tab to work in space.  hacked to avoid client error
    - this class is barely above skeleton code, and hardly researched.
    - jump clones arent even close to implementation, so its nbd at this point

item contraband.....this needs implementing
    - will be used in system security
    - could this be a dataset in static data mgr for market items to avoid loading?

market code
    - determine and code methods for using arum as credit type
    - still needs more review for update/rewrite/improvements
    - fix price shit....db uses double, code uses double, both should be long
    - client has prices to 2 places (xxx.xx).  this is x100 to store/modify as integer.  ALL price data should be updated to use this
    - update pricing queries to move decimal accordingly.  currently NOT moved, so prices are 100x higher (and no decimals)
    - run thru mgr code to remove direct db calls (put in marketDB file)
    - find 'safe' way to run history updates (in case of no transactions)
    - need to run thru file to check for proper coding

market for corp use
    - add checks for hangar location when placing sell orders
    - will need more data and checks for using corp account key (wallet division) properly.  currently cash (div 1)
    - escrow and broker fee have "authorized by" msgs to implement....see common/eve-wallet.h

market history
    - change date on ccp history dump and put into mktHistory table
    - may be cheating, but we'd have 'real' data for market history


EVEItemFlags - update our code for the 89 flags defined in client

player corps - finish wip code for RAM, market  -priority level: med-hi
raceMask isnt implemented yet...will need more thought/coding
still some corp shit not started/completed yet...need to finish it. may need to split file again.  -priority level: med-hi
partial code for corpStations, member roles,
no code for labels
set initial standings when corp is created.
when renting office, station offices dont refresh
do all corps share officeFolderID?  (stationID + Offset)
GetMemberTrackingInfo() incomplete
CorpStationMgrIMBound incomplete
CorpRegistryService incomplete
corp jumpers? - decide/implement
GetMemberIDsByQuery needs more work.  see notes in code.
corp items not updating in db when moved (could be all items as we're not saving every item change)
dividends incomplete
decorations list doesnt include recipients.  also time is shown as elapsed
contacts incomplete
SparseBound will need work for RAM and lock votes (and more)
check items in corp hangar for proper locationID/flagID


m_self is NOT being populated for non-piloted ships.   -priority level: low

these can be found in 'db_shit/output.txt'
locationName = localization.GetByMessageID(self.locationNameID)
    - locationNameID is a messageID!!!
return localization.GetByMessageID(self.ownerNameID, languageID)
    - ownerNameID is a messageID!!!
0 AS landmarkNameID
    - landmarkNameID is a messageID!!!

InvBrokerService needs love
mapservice  needs love
CharMgrService  needs love
notificationMgr  needs love
reproc  needs love
certificateMgr needs looking at
paperDollServer incomplete
factionWarMgr incomplete
ShipService incomplete
LookupService needs update
serviceDB needs update
    - maybe remove "Lookup*" shit to its own db file
StationOffice::ValidateAddItem incomplete (but unused)
    - need tic to determine rent time on office.  implement lockdown when rent unpaid (grace period?  -nope)

KeeperService will need work (accel gates)

PlanetORBBound needs work now that customs offices are working
PI Launch status need *some way* to tick for launch reentry

store/board ship in cap ship hangar not coded

ship selfdestruct not coded

authentication and session still need work, but i dont fully understand them
look into OnSessionMutated to see if we can implement it properly

incursions.  this hasnt even been looked at yet.

expeditions.  not sure how to do this one.
dungeonExplorationMgr::GetMyEscalatingPathDetails()

many unimplemented salvage error msgs noted in prospector.h

OSE::Killed() unfinished.  (structures, empty ships  - need those systems finished first)

still many ClientErrorMgs not used/implemented

look over CallDispatcher to see if we can improve/update anything

noob mining ships to have ore hold?  yes, but small...  100m3 or so
    - reduce cargo hold by 1/2 or better
frigates
ibis?, navitas, bantam, probe, tormentor
cruisers
arbitrator, osprey, scythe, vexor

some items dont have complete description in db (data is truncated)

go thru classes and rename per class type...
    -  *Item  for items
    -  *SE  for system entities

implement remaining UIDs as noted in EVE_Defines.h

F11 map - universe not showing region connecting (jump) lines (should be green for region jumps)

owner notes and owner labels incomplete

trader joe (market bot)
    - use civilian code to move around
    - fleet of ships (haulers, escorts) moving thru systems (universe wide?  multiple traders?)
    - market updates only at station fleet docked in
    - accurate travel times
    - can be attacked, but VERY tough.  will call reinforcements (arrival time tbd)
    - items in haulers for sale at docked station (random)  remove item from hauler when order placed.
    - add data/info to getmultiownersex call

low on the list.....
contraband.
however, there are skills related to it, once implemented  (but not published)
skillSmuggling = 3448, // Trade Proficiency at laying low and avoiding unwanted attention. From a base of 90%, each level of skill reduces by 10% the likelihood of being scanned while transporting contraband.
skillStarshipFreight = 13069, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillMineralFreight = 13070, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillMunitionsFreight = 13071, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillDroneFreight = 13072, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillRawMaterialFreight = 13073, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillConsumableFreight = 13074, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.
skillHazardousMaterialFreight = 13075, // Trade The skill at transporting contraband without getting caught. -10% chance of being caught transporting contraband. Base chance 60%.


skillTaxEvasion = 28261, // Trade Knowledge of the SCC tax regime and the ability to utilize that to one's own advantage.
2% reduction in SCC tax per level.


bounties have a bonus...
skillDEDConnections = 3362, // Social Skill at dealing with Concord Department and negotiating bounties
Bonus fee of 1,500 isk per pirate head per level of the skill

**********************************
*** actually, ALL of the social and trade skills have bonuses.
    - these need to be looked over and implemented.
skillGeneralFreight = 12834, // Trade Skill at the stowage and transportation of bulk goods
5% Bonus per level to Ship Cargo Capacity


check into call returns.  they may be missing data (like callID)
    - i think these are mostly complete.  may be too deep in packet.

*******************************************************
*****************  commands

***  ideas
and add colors where applicable/appropriate
    - currently, skill in training is aqua, others are white.
    - fleet bonuses is only other command that is colored (offhand)

create ".modify" command to allow ingame setting of attributes
    - groove has this functionality in his launcher
    - this is done already, but incomplete.  search for ".dogma" command

***  errors


***  other
finish dot commands
    - model commands on .tr where applicable/appropriate
    - add options for commands
    - .tr still needs lots of work.  basic code is done and working

command .attrlist needs names as well as attrID


*******************************************************
*****************  MEMORY MANAGEMENT and code compliance

DATA RACE!!
    found data race on console log while running under valgrind.(imageSvr and BoundObject calls at same time)
    go thru log and verify MT safe status

RefObjects -
    - current RefObject/RefPtr objects are leaking memory.  getting better, but still horrible.
    - look into removing the Ref* objects and replacing with std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr  (see core/utils/singleton.h)
    -  this may be more work than it's worth, but current Ref* objects arent being tracked properly
    -  the other option is to find/fix the current tracking for Ref* objects, which is only partly implemented (at best) and only partially understood

Py* objects that have string as key need 'delete' called on string when destroyed per valgrind...cannot find ref to this error now
Py* objects that have long int as key need 'delete' called on key when destroyed (mem leak)

PyDatabase may need d'tors coded

see what can be done about bind_args->Clone() as it may be leaking memory
90% of valgrind "Definitely Lost" errors are from "new PyInt()" calls.
    - most of these are Encode() calls


review all classes to add rule of 5 or =delete as required
    - PyRep objects done
    - InventoryItem started (logging to see if other c'tors are used...so far not)
    -

*******************************************************
*****************  Fx shit

***  ideas


***  errors


***  other

update all specialFX to use common call in DestinyManager code.
this includes fx13 and fx10 calls
    - see notes above for specialFX code improvements


*******************************************************
*****************  uk calls
  ** none at this time **  (almost all calls coded, albeit some only skeleton)

  do i want to put unfinished/unimplemented calls here?
  there are a lot, and will take a while to complete that list.


*******************************************************
*****************  xmlp shit

(bloat fix)
look into using "CALL_", "RSP_" and "encode=true/false"/"decode=true/false" for including/omitting the bloated encode/decode sections
  - this will be involved and rather time-consuming

  <elementDef name="GodmaError"><!-- more to this than template has here.  fix later  -->

remove "Notify*" from notify names....implement better naming convention (see above)

*******************************************************
*****************  db shit

all PackedRows are marshalled into a buffer, where None is inserted as zero.
    - this negates client conditional checks like using "if x is None:" because x=0 will return false in that check, which makes shit weird
    - UPDATE  client patched to correct this, using "if x == 0:" after above "None" check

check/add dynamic tables to Dump.sh to avoid copying local server data to repo

*******************************************************
*****************  ideas for later

***  look into using sql prepared statements for oft-used queries  (undecided atm)

****  make safe save method to verify and save data on segfault

check into making module tics faster (like targetMgr) for sub-tic timer calls/checks

aggressionMgr - this obj is system-wide, per system.  bound object could(should) be used for all clients in system

drone chat window for drone specific msgs (using individual drone as sender)
player command to show drones targeted by

warpstate class works very well, and no mem leaks (as opposed to changing to struct)

npc ai - update for better ai. add advanced ai for advanced ship classes   -priority level: low
    - npc will attack drones based on class (find this info again)
    - npc lost target <- this method needs better thought to pick next target
    - should npc have 'pool' of available/preferred targets
update npc ai. wander working. warp in/out working. tracking somewhat wonky.   -priority level: low

ADD THIS....
get npc *something* to check damage done by npc.
once damage starts dropping, check distance and move accordingly

charge chars for jetcans?

rats should test for faction signals in system and set origin along that direction (to appear they came from their 'base' in system)
    - this should be fairly easy to set up
    - if no faction presence in system, continue with random point

civilian class - non-combatant ships moving from one point to another. skeleton code and notes in class file.   -priority level: low

expanded cargo modules update for specialized holds.   -priority level: low
    - there are some client checks for updated hold capy
     if attributeID in (const.attributeCapacity,
         const.attributeDroneCapacity,
         const.attributeShipMaintenanceBayCapacity,
         const.attributeCorporateHangarCapacity):
            sm.ScatterEvent('OnCapacityChange', itemKey)

need to figure out how to load/queue assets for chars (on login or w/e)
    - this is needed for complete asset menu entries

integrate UTF8 into code (or make my own class)
   - same with zlib and gangsta
   - is zlib even used??

inventory item - populate - effect timestamp
    - this needs to be tracked/updated for proper effects handing and tracking.
    - could be a problem with movement being funky

update ValidateAddItem() to return >0 on error and use enums to determine/display error (see char::injectskillintobrain)
    - there are many methods with this name.  i dont remember which one i was referring to here.

make log/config option for (en/dis)able client massive check.

validate ship pilot skills to assemble/repack ship?
    - is this a 'service' by station personnel?  yeah, probably so.
    - charge for assemble/repack service?

speaking of charges, how about a freight charge when moving large amounts of stuff?
     would this be docking charge?  no, that's akin to a full service gas station.  fill 'er up, check oil, wash windows, etc.
     based on standings with station owner?

boosters damage/kill character (see description of 'Crash')
others cause multiple other effects.  is this something we can implement/exploit?


*******************************************************
*****************   errata and miscellaneous bullshit

remove /test from compilation (not needed for normal use)

move skills to separate db table

dont remember why i put this log in, but it got hit while testing earlier....
19:54:01 [Service] config::GetMultiLocationsEx()
19:54:01 W GetMultiLocationsEx: Asteroid Item requested.
19:54:03 [Service] config::GetMultiLocationsEx()
19:54:03 W GetMultiLocationsEx: Asteroid Item requested.
19:54:05 [Service] config::GetMultiLocationsEx()
19:54:05 W GetMultiLocationsEx: Asteroid Item requested.

17908 - nerf bat    <<-- this is `QA Cruise Missile`  100km/s, 1k multi-spectral damage

GM/WM slash commands arent parsed in server (rclick '/create this type'....etc)

i have a sneaky suspicion 'throw' isnt used properly throughout the entire codebase

update console commands to use complete words instead of first letter
    - this will enable greater command control and passing of arguments

object cache system still not understood or fully utilized. (part of bulkdata shit)
entire system needs lookover.

rework bulkdata code.
the current code is hacked to send bulk data in segments.  live uses *some other form* of data, which *MAY* be our cache files.
will need to look into this and determine how they use those files and the checksums to determine what to send.
as this is still beyond me, it may take a while.
till then, we'll have to used the hacked system.
after all, it works

item flags are stored in db as 'entity.flag', but client wants 'flagID'.
look into changing our code to conform.  most objects are built in-code and use flagID already, but some items need "flag AS flagID" in sql query.

figure out how to colorize _log() msgs to console   -priority level: low

CmdStargateJump has multiple client-side msgs that would be fun to implement (system shut down due to traffik, closed from congestion, etc)

holoscreenMgr is mostly empty (skeleton code)
ideas for holoscreen in CQ:
    - corp recruit ads
    - incursion data
    - relevant system data for player's current system
    - others?
    - more?

OnItemsChanged is for multiple changes in a single return.  -priority level: low
    - look into how we can implement this return, if needed, instead of using multiple returns (consolidate packet sending)

_Prime uses slimItem.ownerID to set keys, which are then fetch()'d from RecordSet.EveOwners (or server if empty)
    - as ownerID defaults to '0', client throws error when receives 'None' as response  (need more the 0 values to unpack)
    - all ownerIDs should be actual EveOwners, (default to current system owner when SOV is implemented), NOT '0' or '_System' (which is 1)
    -  could this be part of "EveOwners" bulkdata, which is why client is throwing error?  look into and fix as needed.

stations - look into individual hangers loaded into mem objects (charid/items)
    - not sure if this would be worth it, but would make 'by owner' searches much faster

destiny shit - misc things found in destiny.dll
    - markers for ball's yaw, pitch, roll (dunRotation)
    - cruise velocity as a fraction of max velocity (uk)
    - id of bubble ball belongs to, current and former (uk)
    - dunRotation is used for accel gates, customs offices, moon miners, and possibly others i havent found yet

need timer/var for after cloak for targeting (cannot target x sec after uncloak - currently no delay)

so, cannot get info on cap ships with clone service because of incomplete jumpCloneSvc.
jump clones - when i start this, need to check into diff between active clone and jumpclone.
may have to rearrange things to properly implement jump clones.

GetChar()->HasShares())  // not written, no underlying code yet

static items not being removed from itemfactory map upon system unload (station removal fixed)

began putting specific throw msgs in appropriate common/EVE_*.h files if available,
else src/*/*.h files

Ref: ServerError numbers are a bit whacky.  others are just wrong.
i have placeholders in some as 'xxxxx' which need fixing
update sending Ref: ServerError xxxxx msgs on errors without existing msgs.
    - this includes all decode errors

create data needed for killboard, and integrate killboard into site  -priority level: low
    - page started.  data non-existent  will use src/eve-core/killboard/

Profile::GetRunTimes()  - adjust this to Automatically set us/ms/s as needed  ....not working right.  later.

player agent/error msgs - pool of msgs adjusted for character secstatus or standings with corp/sov holder, a la sphereScript's speech files

when cynos are implemented, remember to update mapDynamicData for counts on both fields and generators

stations have a reprocessingHangarFlag.
implement this for RAM shit (they are all 4, but whatever)  -priority level: low
- could this be changed by player?

better checks and reverts when creating corps fail
- updated to not check for failure when adding data to evestaticowners, walletdivisions and corpshares

implants....update existing data for more bonus.  as we are running ~60 on char attributes (vs ~20 on live), existing 1-6pt implants are negligable.
    update for ~20+ or so points to make a difference with our attributes
    implant map in character.h  -currently unused/unimplemented

turns use quaternion lerp curve (and mass/agility somehow)

system mem obj for jumpsHour isnt working and will take more thought/code
    - the idea for it is to keep track of jumps and times, then as time passes, remove those jumps from db data to show trend

gain rep with broker agents to modify fees?

set up universe monitor for watching jumps
    - what file / where would this be coded?
    - how would it run?
when jumps > xx send "system closed" and "system congested" msgs to pilots trying to jump in.
...other things?

there is a lot more to machonet than we currently have coded/working....
    - narrowcast is for notification types of "broadcast" using "bcast_idtype"


make EACS and E-UNI corps as tribute (static)?
    - others?  goons?
