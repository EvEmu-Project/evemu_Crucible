C++ provides six default operations, sometimes also called special functions, for managing the lifecycle of an object.
The default operations are related. This means if you implement or =delete one of them, you have to think about the five others.
These operations are:
    a default constructor: X()
    a copy constructor: X(const X&)
    a copy assignment: operator=(const X&)
    a move constructor: X(X&&)
    a move assignment: operator=(X&&)
    a destructor: ~X()

C++ provides value semantic and not reference semantic for its types.
    Value semantic: Value (or “copy”) semantics mean assignment copies the value, not just the pointer.
    Reference semantic: With reference semantics, assignment is a pointer-copy (i.e., a reference).



The 9 default operations rules in C++:
    C.80: Use =default if you have to be explicit about using the default semantics
    C.81: Use =delete when you want to disable default behavior (without wanting an alternative)
    C.82: Don’t call virtual functions in constructors and destructors
    C.83: For value-like types, consider providing a noexcept swap function
    C.84: A swap may not fail
    C.85: Make swap noexcept
    C.86: Make == symmetric with respect of operand types and noexcept
    C.87: Beware of == on base classes
    C.89: Make a hash noexcept



Does my class need a destructor?
Most of the times the answer is no and you are fine with the rule of zero.
Sometimes the answer is yes and we are back to the rule of five.
The guidelines provide eight rules for destructors:
    C.30: Define a destructor if a class needs an explicit action at object destruction
    C.31: All resources acquired by a class must be released by the class’s destructor
    C.32: If a class has a raw pointer (T*) or reference (T&), consider whether it might be owning
    C.33: If a class has an owning pointer member, define a destructor
    C.34: If a class has an owning reference member, define a destructor
    C.35: A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or protected and nonvirtual
    C.36: A destructor may not fail
    C.37: Make destructors noexcept

    static variable (class)
    lifetime = program runtime (1)
    visibility = determined by access modifiers (private/protected/public)

    static variable (global scope)
    lifetime = program runtime (1)
    visibility = the compilation unit it is instantiated in (2)

    heap variable
    lifetime = defined by you (new to delete)
    visibility = defined by you (whatever you assign the pointer to)

    stack variable
    visibility = from declaration until scope is exited
    lifetime = from declaration until declaring scope is exited
