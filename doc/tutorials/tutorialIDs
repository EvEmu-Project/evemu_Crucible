(54104, `Every ship has a cargo hold. You use the cargo hold to carry items around with you. To open your cargo, click the cargo button. It is highlighted now. <br><br>

To loot an item and place it into your cargo hold, simply drag and drop the item from the structure or wreck window into your cargo hold window. You may also press "Loot All" to move everything to your ship's cargo at once.`)
(54105, `Your work here is done. You should head back to the station to complete the mission and accept your rewards. Select the station in the overview and then select the <font color=yellow><b>dock</b></font> option from the selected items panel. Alternatively you can right click anywhere in space and use the contextual menu to dock at the station.`)
(54106, `You can also use your speed to “tank” vessels using turret-based weaponry, simply by flying in a way that makes you more difficult to track. This is called “speed tanking” and works on the concept of <b><font color=yellow>transversal velocity</font></b>. <br><br>
If your ship was sitting still, it would have zero transversal velocity, and it would be very easy for guns to hit you. As a general rule, the faster your ship moves, the greater its transversal velocity, but only if you move your ship laterally across the face of the hostile vessel shooting you. <br><br>
If you were to fly directly towards a hostile gunship you would have a very low transversal velocity, regardless of your speed, and guns would be able to hit you easily.
