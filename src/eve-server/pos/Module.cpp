/** @note  basic notes on player owned structures
 *  Control Towers
 *
 * Control towers are the cornerstone of any POS setup.
 * The choice of tower and size will determine how much fuel you use per month and how much PG/CPU you have for onlined (active) structures.
 * Smaller towers will often have to leave modules anchored but offline until needed due to limited PG/CPU.
 *
 *    Amarr - first in PG, fourth in CPU
 *    Caldari - fourth in PG, first in CPU
 *    Gallente - third in PG, second in CPU
 *    Minmatar - second in PG, third in CPU
 *    Faction - reduced fuel costs, more HP, shorter anchor/online timer
 *
 * At the time of writing, faction tower fuel savings require about 2-3 years before the fuel cost savings will outweigh the cost of a faction tower over a regular tower.
 * If you are living in a wormhole or are having logistical issues with getting enough fuel to the tower on a regular basis, faction towers may be a better choice.
 * Faction towers have more hit points and lower anchor and online times than non-faction towers.
 *
 * Note that faction towers in lo-sec / hi-sec can be a security risk as they will potentially draw unwanted attention from other players.
 * Their high cost may be a deciding factor in whether an attack takes place.
 * Assembly Arrays
 *
 * Assembly arrays are mounted inside the POS bubble and are used to construct modules, ships, and other items.
 * They function similar to the manufacturing slots in NPC stations.
 *
 * - need short blurb of how to use, where can the BPO be located, where can raw materials be located, where does output go
 * S/M/L Ship Assembly Array
 *
 * There are (3) sizes of the regular ship assembly arrays.
 * There must be a Ship Maintenance Array (SMA) within range (2500m?) of the Ship Assembly Array in order to use the production lines.
 * When ships roll off the production lines, they are stored in the SMA.
 * These arrays can be anchored in all security classifications (hi/lo/null).
 *
 *    Small (SSAA) - T1 Frigates, T1 Destroyers, T1 Fighter and Fighter Bomber Drones
 *    Medium (MSAA) - T1 Cruisers, T1 Battlecruisers, T1 Barges, T1 Industrials
 *    Large (LSAA) - (3) lines, T1 Battleships, T1 Freighters, T1 Industrial Command Ships
 *
 * Under the old system where arrays were NPC-sold, all three sizes cost about 80M ISK.
 * In 2010, CCP changed things so that players would have to use resources from Planetary Interaction in order to construct the arrays.
 *
 * For hi-sec use, where you have manufacturing slots available in nearby stations (which are far cheaper on a per-hour basis),
 * the only real use of a ship assembly array is bulk storage.
 * The SSAA and MSAA both hold 2M m3 of materials, while the LSAA holds a massive 18.5M m3.
 * All sizes of ship assembly arrays have corporate hangar tabs to make organization easier.
 * However, while the LSAA holds 9x more cargo then the SSAA/MSAA siblings, it only requires 4x the CPU and 3x the PG of the SSAA.
 * So for bulk storage in a hi-sec POS, the LSAA is a very popular choice.
 *
 * In order for a member to use a Ship Assembly Array as storage, you should use the tower management screen and
 * change permissions on the xSAA module to "Corporation" or "Alliance".
 * Do not hand out roles like "Config Starbase Equipment" or "Starbase Fuel Technician" (unless you absolutely want to).
 *
 * Advanced S/M/L Ship Assembly Arrays
 *
 * - T2 ship construction
 *
 * - should not be used for regular ship production due to 10% increase in materials required
 *
 * The advanced ship assembly arrays should only be used in w-space or deep null-sec where there are no station slots for
 * manufacturing due to the 10% penalty in material requirements.
 * X-Large Ship Assembly Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 1000tf CPU, 300k MW PG
 *    Size: 25,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 18.5M m3
 *    Op Range: 3000m
 *    Slots: 3 Manufacturing (0.75x time, 1.0x materials)
 *    Restrictions: Security level less than 0.5 (null through 0.4 sec)
 *
 * Allows the construction of large ships such as T1 Battleships, T1 Carriers, T1 Dreadnoughts, T1 Freighters,
 * T1 Industrial Command Ships and T1 Capital Industrial Ships. This array cannot be anchored in hi-sec space.
 * Fitting requirements are identical to that of the LSAA, but are more expensive to produce with Planetary Interaction.
 * In order to directly use a ship produced by the XLSAA, you must also anchor a Ship Maintenance Array.
 * Capital Ship Assembly Array
 * Capital Ship Assembly Arrayâ€Ž
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 30s Anchor, 10s Online, 600s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 2000tf CPU, 1000k MW PG
 *    Size: 850,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 155M m3
 *    Op Range: 3000m
 *    Slots: 1 Manufacturing
 *    Restrictions: Null-sec with system sovereignty
 *    Requires: Supercapital Construction Facilities Infrastructure Upgrade
 *
 * Allows for the construction of capital ships such as Dreadnoughts, Carriers, Supercarriers, Titans.
 * However, they are generally only used for the construction of Supercarriers and Titans as Carriers/Dreads can be constructed
 * using the much less expensive X-Large Ship Assembly Array.
 *
 * Anchoring one of these arrays will ensure negative attention from larger alliances who will suspect that you are building
 * super-caps or titans. Very expensive to construct using Planetary Interaction (the BPO alone is 500M ISK).
 * Note that in order to move these around, you must have a ship with an 850k m3 cargo bay.

 *    Capacity: 500k m3
 *    Op Range: 3000m
 *    Slots: 6 Manufacturing (0.75x time, 1.0x materials)
 *
 * The Equipment Assembly Array (EAA) is used to manufacture ship modules. Slower, but more efficient then the Rapid Equipment Assembly Array.
 * Rapid Equipment Assembly Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 200tf CPU, 110k MW PG
 *    Size: 6250 m3
 *    Capacity: 500k m3
 *    Op Range: 3000m
 *    Slots: 5 Manufacturing (0.65x time, 1.2x materials)
 *
 * The Rapid Equipment Assembly Array (REAA) is used to manufacture ship modules. Faster, but less efficient (+20% material requirement) then the Equipment Assembly Array.
 * Subsystem Assembly Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 5s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 500tf CPU, 200k MW PG
 *    Size: 17,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 2M m3
 *    Op Range: 3000m
 *    Slots: 3 Manufacturing (1.0x time, 1.0x materials)
 *
 * The Subsystem Assembly Array (SAA) allows you to assemble Tech III hulls and advanced subsystems.
 * However, the hulls and subsystems can only be assembled (fitted?) when docked at a station.
 * Storage
 *
 * All storage arrays should be anchored inside the POS bubble.
 * Corporate Hangar Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 150tf CPU, 100k MW PG
 *    Size: 4,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 1.4M m3
 *    Op Range: Within POS shield
 *
 * Designed to provide floating corporate hangars at the POS tower, complete with normal corporate hangar features like divisional tabs.
 * Because this array uses CPU, it will not be accessible if the POS is reinforced. If you need more storage, you may wish to use a LSAA instead.
 *
 * Since this array will be unavailable once the POS tower enters reinforced mode that you should not store spare ammo or batteries in the array.
 * Spare items like ammo/batteries should be stored in anchored secure containers in safe-spots, or in a nearby station.
 *
 * If the array is destroyed by enemy fire (after the POS shield is gone) then the contents will drop as loot according to the standard loot rules
 * (typically 50% of the stacks survive destruction).
 * However, if the hangar is scooped up, taken to a station and repackaged, it may be possible to recover the contents
 * (not extensively tested - and conflicting reports of success/failure).
 * Personal Hangar Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 150tf CPU, 100k MW PG
 *    Size: 4,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 50K m3 per individual
 *    Op Range: Within POS shield
 *
 * A large hangar structure, for easy storage of materials and modules.
 * This hangar is designed for personal storage of moderate volume items, and each individual only has access to their own section of the storage space.
 * As with the Corporate Hangar Array, the Personal Hangar Array uses CPU and therefore will not be accessible if the POS is reinforced.
 * If you need more storage, you may wish to use a LSAA instead.
 * Ship Maintenance Array
 * Ship Maintenance Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 250k MW PG (no CPU)
 *    Size: 8,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 20M m3 (assembled ships only)
 *    Op Range: Within POS shield
 *
 * The Ship Maintenance Array (SMA), when anchored and online, provides a place to store fitted/rigged ships.
 * Ships can only be stored in the SMA if their cargo bay is empty of everything except for charges (ammo, scripts, crystals, probes).
 * It can be used by up to 10 pilots simultaneously to refit their ships at the POS if they are within 3000m of the SMA.
 * The SMA can be used/accessed even if the POS is in reinforced mode because it requires zero CPU in order to operate.
 * Capital Ship Maintenance Array
 * Capital Ship Maintenance Array
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 30s Anchor, 10s Online, 600s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 1000k MW PG (no CPU)
 *    Size: 40,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 155M m3 (assembled ships only)
 *    Op Range: Within POS shield
 *    Restrictions: null-sec with system sovereignty
 *    Requires: Supercapital Construction Facilities Infrastructure Upgrade
 *
 * The Capital Ship Maintenance Array (CSMA) is a larger version of the SMA only useful in player controlled null-sec.
 * It only uses power and can be used/accessed even if the POS is reinforced.
 * Cynos, Jammers and Jump Bridges
 *
 * These structures are used to make travel between systems faster or to prevent enemies from generating cynosural fields.
 * Cynosural Generator Array
 * Cynosural Generator Array
 *
 *    Location: 15km+ outside POS bubble
 *    Times: 10s Anchor, 300s Online, 10s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 150tf CPU, 375k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    HP: 1M Shield, 15M Armor, 100k Structure
 *    Restrictions: null-sec with system sovereignty
 *    Requires: Cynosural Navigation Infrastructure Upgrade
 *    Limitations: Max of 1 per system
 *
 * The Cynosural Generator Array (CGA) is a stationary cynosural field generator which allows capital ships with jump drives to jump
 * to the POS's location from surrounding systems without the need for a cyno ship.
 * Once anchored and onlined, the cynosural field remains active at all times.
 * It may take a few hours until downtime until the beacon shows up for all pilots in the corp/alliance.
 * Be warned that if you jump to a CGA, you will have to slow-boat around 15km to duck inside the POS bubble at the destination.
 * If the POS is currently camped, this may be a fatal blunder.
 * Cynosural System Jammer
 * Cynosural System Jammer
 *
 *    Location: 15km+ outside POS bubble
 *    Times: 300s Anchor, 1800s Online, 60s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 750k MW PG (no CPU)
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    HP: 1M Shield, 15M Armor, 100k Structure
 *    Restrictions: null-sec with system sovereignty
 *    Requires: Cynosural Suppression Infrastructure Upgrade
 *    Limitations: Max of 1 per system
 *
 * Prevents the generation of normal cynosural fields (does not affect covert cynosural fields).
 * Note that this prevents all cynosural activity, including attempts to light beacons by friendly pilots.
 *
 * - Question: Does the CSJ prevent the operation of a CGA in the system or can the two co-exist?
 * Jump Bridge
 * Jump Bridge
 *
 *    Location: 15km+ outside of a POS bubble
 *    Delays: Anchor: 30 sec, Online: 30 min, Unanchor: 60 sec
 *    Fitting: CPU: 4,000 tf, PowerGrid: 750k MW
 *    Size: 100,000 m3
 *    HP: 1 mil Shield, 15 mil Armor, 100K Structure (0% resists)
 *    Fuel Bay: 30,000 m3 of Liquid Ozone (75,000 units)
 *    Operation Range: 2,500m
 *    Restrictions: Null Sec Space with system sovereignty
 *    Requires: Advanced Logistics Network Infrastructure Upgrade
 *    Limitations: Max of 1 per Solar System
 *      fuel used = (liquid ozone) (500 * Jump distance in LY) * (ship mass / 1,000,000,000))
 * Used to link two Star Base in different systems to allow all ships to jump between systems without the need to setup a cynosural field.
 * Maximum jump range is 5 Light Years. Also see Jump Bridge.
 * Labs, Reactors and Silos
 * Mobile Laboratory
 * Mobile Laboratory
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 500tf CPU, 100k MW PG
 *    Size: 3000 m3
 *    Slots: 1 Copy (0.75x time), 3 ME (0.75x time), 3 PE (0.75 time), 5 Invention (0.5x time)
 *    Capacity: 25k m3
 *    Range: Within POS Shield
 *
 * Basic laboratory used for the research (material and time) of BPOs.
 * Also useful for Invention due to the (5) invention slots.
 * ME/PE research can by done on the tower by any corporation within the alliance who has a station office rented in the same system.
 * Copy/Invention requires access to the mobile laboratory storage and thus is limited to the corporation who owns the POS tower.
 *
 * In order for corporation members to use the array for invention (and copying?), you will need to change the
 * query/take permissions using the POS tower's management screen.
 * In that screen you can change who is able to "query" from "Starbase Fuel Technician" to "Corporation" and you will change
 * the "take" from "Config Starbase Equipment" to "Corporation".
 *
 * If a laboratory array is taken offline, any jobs that were running on that array will be paused.
 * If the laboratory array is then unanchored, any BPOs inside the array will be destroyed.
 * If the BPOs were kept in a station in the same system, then all research progress will be lost but the BPO will not be destroyed during the unanchor process.
 * If the tower is still intact, you cannot unanchor a mobile lab that has items inside (you will have to put it back online, empty it out, then go back to unanchoring it).
 * Advanced Mobile Laboratory
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 600tf CPU, 120k MW PG
 *    Size: 3000 m3
 *    Slots: 3 Copy (0.65x time), 2 ME (0.75x time), 2 Invention (0.5x time)
 *    Capacity: 25k m3
 *    Range: Within POS Shield
 *
 * Mostly used when you need a lot of copy slots for T2 production.
 * Most POS towers will run a mix of AMLs and MLs to balance out the ME/PE/copy/invention slots to meet user's needs.
 * For instance, a mix of five AMLs and six MLs will give 28 ME / 12 PE / 21 copy / 40 invention slots.
 *
 * Moon Harvesting Array
 *
 * Moon Harvesting Arrays are structures for Moon Mining.
 * When set up correctly, they will extract raw materials from the moon you starbase is Anchored at.
 * Depending on your configuration, the Harvester Array will pass the materials onto a Reactor Array for reaction or will store them in a Silo.
 *
 *    Location: Inside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 3s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 500tf CPU, 10k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *
 * - low/null sec moon mining structures
 * Refining Arrays
 *
 * Refining Arrays (better known as Mobile Refineries) allow you to reprocess ore at a starbase.
 * You must load the Refinery with the ore (only one ore type is allowed in the refinery at a time).
 * Once loaded, right-click the Refinery and start the process. Unlike stations, the process is not immediate.
 * You have to wait between 1 and 3 hours before the contents of the Refinery are changed into minerals.
 *
 * There are three types of Mobile Refinery:
 * Refining Array

 *    Capacity: 200,000 m3
 *    Restricted to Security < 0.4
 *    20K Shield | 20K Armor | 10K Structure
 *
 *
 * Note that the Refining Arrays refining yield efficiency does not apply to ice ores, which are always refined at the maximum efficiency the operator is capable of.
 * Also, if the array's control tower runs out of fuel while the array is in the middle of a processing operation, the materials being refined will be irrevocably lost.
 *
 * For further information see POS Refining.
 * Silos
 *
 * Silos are used to store Raw Materials, Processed Materials, Advanced Materials or Minerals.
 * A Silo can only hold one type of material at a time and must be put offline to change type or to empty it.
 *
 * Silo varieties:
 * Biochemical Silo
 *
 *    Specialized container designed to store and handle gas clouds.

 *    Size: 4,000 m3
 *    Capacity: 20,000 m3
 *
 * Coupling Array
 *
 * Coupling Arrays act as an intermediary holding pipe between two structures.
 * Take for instance the Moon Harvesting Array and Silo.
 * Since you must offline your Silo before emptying it, you may lose a cycle of raw materials.
 * By placing a Coupling Array between the Harvester and Silo, you can safely offline the Silo while you empty it and
 * any Raw Materials that arrive will temporarily be stored in the Coupler Array.
 *
 * The Coupling Array is also useful for when the Harvesters and a Reactor are running/processing at different speeds.
 * For instance, two Harvesters may produce 100 units each an hour. The Reactor may only be able to process the said units every 2 hours.
 * This leaves you with a surplus of 100 units that will be lost in the process.
 * A Coupling Array acts as a buffer to temporarily hold the surplus materials until the Reactor is free.

 *    Fitting: 250tf CPU, 150k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    Types: 1 for each resist (EMP, EXP, KIN, THE)
 *    Strength: 25% (but with stacking penalties)
 *
 * Shield hardeners come in four types, one for each resist, and should be mounted inside the POS bubble.
 * They are named Ballistic Deflection Array (KIN), Explosion Dampening Array (EXP), Heat Dissipation Array (THE), and Photon Scattering Array (EMP).
 * Since shield hardening arrays are inside the bubble, they cannot be targeted until the tower is destroyed.
 * However, they become inactive once the tower enters reinforced mode.

 * Sensor Dampening Battery
 *
 *    Location: 5km+ outside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 120s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 25tf CPU, 12.5k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    HP: 100k Shield, 1.5M Armor, 100k Structure
 *    Range: 300km Activation, 150km Optimal, 150km Falloff
 *
 * The Sensor Dampening Battery cuts the target's scan resolution and targeting range in half.
 * It has very low fitting requirements and can force an enemy to come closer to POS weapons instead of being able to sit at long range and snipe.
 * Just like any other module that targets enemy ships, it must be mounted outside the POS bubble and can be attacked by enemy ships before the POS tower is destroyed.
 *
 * There are two schools of thought with regards to Sensor Dampening Batteries.
 * One is that they are completely unnecessary if you have faction ECM batteries with their 200km optimal + 100km falloff range.
 * The other school of thought is that a few Sensor Dampening Batteries never hurt and could be used to good effect by POS gunners.
 * Either way, you will generally not need more then a small handful (as few as 1-3, probably no more then 6) of these and your tower defenses
 * will be fine without any at all (as long as you have ECM).
 *
 * Note: Dreads are immune to sensor dampening in siege mode and carriers are immune if in triage mode.
 * ECM Batteries
 *
 *    Location: 5km+ outside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 120s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 50tf CPU, 25k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    HP: 100k Shield, 1.5M Armor, 100k Structure
 *    Range: 300km Activation, 200km Optimal, 100km Falloff
 *    Jam Strength: 45 for primary, 15 for secondaries
 *
 * The four ECM batteries are Ion Field Projection Battery (MAGNET, Gallente), Phase Inversion Battery (LADAR, Minmatar),
 * Spatial Destabilization Battery (GRAV, Caldari) and White Noise Generation Battery (RADAR, Amarr).
 *
 * Faction versions of these modules are recommended but will cost about 6x-10x more.
 * A regular faction ECM battery (Gurista) will have 51 primary / 17 secondary jam strength and the advanced faction ECM battery (Dread Gurista)
 * will have 76 primary / 25 secondary jam strength. The Dread Gurista versions are worth the cost if you expect hostiles at the tower.
 * With their increased jam strength, even ECCM-fitted battleships will constantly lose their locks and have to retarget.
 *
 * See POS Warfare (ECM section) for more details on proper use of ECM.

 *
 * There are two major reasons why missile / torpedo batteries are rarely used.
 * First off is the travel time of the missiles, the second is that they are the only offensive batteries that use CPU power.
 * Due to this use of CPU power, once the POS tower goes into reinforced mode, all missile batteries will go offline and be worthless.
 * The only way to put the missile batteries back online is to wait for the POS to come out of reinforced mode, repair the shields up
 * to 50% or higher, and then manually put each missile battery back online.

 * Projectile batteries are popular, even on non-Minmatar towers because their damage can be tuned with the appropriate choice of ammunition.
 * Good ammunition to use with projectile batteries are Fusion (EXP/KIN), Phased Plasma (THE/KIN) and EMP (EMP/EXP/KIN) or Titanium Sabot (KIN/EXP).
 * The long-range ammunition versions are not needed and will do less damage.
 * Faction ammunition is a popular choice for the increased alpha / DPS.

 * Energy Neutralizing Battery
 * Energy Neutralizing Battery
 *
 *    Location: 5km+ outside POS bubble
 *    Times: 5s Anchor, 120s Online, 5s Unanchor
 *    Fitting: 25tf CPU, 350k MW PG
 *    Size: 4000 m3
 *    HP: 100k Shield, 1.5M Armor, 100k Structure
 *    Range: 300km Activation, 250km Max Range
 *
 * Neutralizes up to 1000 GJ of capacitor energy every 10 seconds. Very heavy powergrid requirements, not recommended for small or medium towers.
 * In comparison, most battleships have around 4,000 to 6,000 GJ of capacitor with 10-30 GJ/s recharge.
 * These weapons are most often used against enemy carriers in triage mode. Rarely used in hi-sec tower defense due to the heavy fitting requirements
 * and it is generally better to employ additional ECM batteries.
