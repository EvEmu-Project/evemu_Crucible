# Live Patch Notes — xrizonx/evemu_Crucible

This file tracks fixes and maintenance changes made on this fork's `master` branch. Entries describe code changes, not a guarantee that every gameplay path has been manually tested.

## 2026-11-13

### Fixed

- **Search result column mismatch:** Updated all ten search-category queries in `src/eve-server/search/SearchDB.cpp` to return the two columns expected by `DBResultToIntIntDict`. This addresses the reported `DBCore::GetInt: Column index 1 exceeds number of columns in row (1)` failure in those search paths.
- **Defensive database result conversion:** Added a column-count check to `DBResultToIntIntDict` in `src/eve-common/database/EVEDBUtils.cpp`, preventing reads from a missing second column.
- **Defensive database row access:** Added null/result/column bounds checks to `DBResultRow::GetText()` in `src/eve-core/database/dbcore.h`.
- **Probe processing iterator safety:** Fixed probe iteration in `src/eve-server/EntityList.cpp`. A probe can remove itself while being processed; the loop now advances safely and only erases the expected map entry. Related upstream report: [#170](https://github.com/EvEmu-Project/evemu_Crucible/issues/170).
- **MySQL reconnect option compatibility:** Replaced the legacy `my_bool` reconnect variable with `bool` and passed its address directly in `src/eve-core/database/dbcore.cpp`. Related upstream report: [#319](https://github.com/EvEmu-Project/evemu_Crucible/issues/319).

### Verification

- GitHub Actions build workflow: [run #107](https://github.com/xrizonx/evemu_Crucible/actions/runs/43454803533).
- At the time this entry was written, Docker, Windows UCRT64 GCC and Linux GCC jobs were still running. Check the workflow for the final result.
- These changes have not yet been confirmed by a full in-game regression test. The repository's current CTest configuration previously reported no tests found.
- No database migration is required for these source fixes.

## Patch-note policy

- Add an entry when a code fix is committed to this fork.
- Link upstream issues where a relationship is confirmed.
- Distinguish **fixed**, **investigating**, and **not reproduced** items.
- Record build/CI status separately from in-game verification.
- Do not describe a report as fixed solely because a defensive guard was added; verify the underlying behavior where possible.
